##Project Tycho Prototype!

####Setup Instructions

You need to run a local python server in order for the app to work properly.
To do this, run 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer' on the command line from inside the Project Tycho directory. 
Then open http://localhost:8000/main.html in your browser.

You will need to have python installed on your machine in order to do this.

If you are having trouble, please contact Hans. In the meantime, take a look at the screenshots in the Screenshots directory of this repo.


####Note from Aly:
Things you should know;

My team is working on the landing page and an index page which are included. Right now, the main page is holding  the app until they are finished.

The content on the main html page will be put on index page when finished

Landing page needs (major f__king) help

main page map is sorta responsive -- it will resize on page resize

Thinking about making the three balls that display numerical data look like a molecule using photo    shop (I used it to make background images)

parsing the data has consumed most of my time. The data is a mess, specifically the date but I am repairing it in csv.

use range bar/ slider to access data
or use the animation button on top. The duration is not set correctly but it works

hover over circles to get total disease for the state

I have only dealt with chickenpox data for this concept so if there are data-vis changes I don't have to restructure all of the data.


Happy looking,

Aly
