									<span class="pox-header2">CHICKEN POX INFORMATION</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">What is chickenpox?</h4>
										<span>Chickenpox is a disease that causes an itchy rash of blisters
										and a fever. A person with chickenpox may have a lot
										of blisters – as many as 500. The rash can spread over the
										whole body—even inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital
										area. Chickenpox can be serious and even life-threatening,
										especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened
										immune systems.</span>

										<img src="images/ChickenpoxModal.png" class="img-responsive modal-pics">
									</div>
								</div>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">What are the symptoms of chickenpox?</h4>
										<span>Chickenpox usually causes the following symptoms:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>An itchy rash of blisters</li>
										<li>Fever</li>
										<li>Headache</li>
										<li>Feeling tired</li>
									</ul>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">Is it serious?</h4>
										<span>Chickenpox is usually mild in children, but the itching can be very uncomfortable. Children with chickenpox can miss up to one week of school or childcare.
										Before the vaccine was available, about 4 million people got chickenpox each year in the United States. About 10,600 of those people were hospitalized, and 100 to 150 died each year.
										In some cases, chickenpox can cause serious problems, such as:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Skin infections</li>
										<li>Dehydration (not having enough water in the body)</li>
										<li>Pneumonia (an infection in the lungs)</li>
										<li>Swelling of the brain</li>
									</ul>
								</div><!-- end Chickenpox first col first row -->
								<div class="col-md-6"><!-- Chickenpox second col first row -->
									<h4 class="pox-header2">How does chickenpox spread?</h4>
										<span>Chickenpox spreads easily through the air when a person who has chickenpox coughs or sneezes. It can also spread by touching an infected person’s blisters.</span>
										<span> Chickenpox can be spread 1 to 2 days before the infected person gets a rash until all the blisters have formed scabs.</span>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">Why not let my child get chickenpox naturally and build natural immunity?</h4>
										<span>Chickenpox can be a mild disease, but it isn’t always. There’s no way to know who will have a mild case and who will become very sick. When your child gets his or her chickenpox shots, he or she is getting immunity from chickenpox without the risk of serious complications of the disease.</span>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">How can I protect my child from chickenpox</h4>
									<span>The best way to protect against chickenpox is by getting the chickenpox (also called varicella) shot. Doctors recommend
									that all children who have never had
									chickenpox get the shot. Why should my child get the chickenpox
									shot?</span>
									<span>The chickenpox shot:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Protects your child from chickenpox, a potentially
										serious and even deadly disease</li>
										<li>Prevents your child from feeling itchy and
										uncomfortable from chickenpox</li>
										<li>Keeps your child from missing school or childcare
										(and keeps you from missing work to care for your
										sick child)</li>
									</ul>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">Is the chickenpox shot safe?</h4>
										<span>Yes. The chickenpox shot is very safe, and it works very
										well to prevent chickenpox. Vaccines, like any medicine,
										can have side effects, but most children who get the
										chickenpox shot have no side effects.</span>
								<br>
									<h4 class="pox-header2">What are the side effects?</h4>
										<span>Most children don’t have any side effects from the shot.
										However, some children may develop a reaction and
										symptoms may include:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot
										was given</li>
										<li>Fever</li>
										<li>Mild rash...</li>

								<br>
								<br> 
									<span><em>The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles-mumps-rubella shot (called the MMR shot). Doctors recommend that all children get the MMR shot.</em></span>
								<br>
								<br>

									<span class="measles-header2">What is measles?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Measles is a serious respiratory disease (in the lungs and breathing tubes) that causes a rash and fever. It is very contagious. In rare cases, it can be deadly.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="measles-header2">What are the symptoms of measles?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Measles starts with a fever that can get very high. Some of the other symptoms that may occur are:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Cough, runny nose, and red eyes</li>
										<li>Rash of tiny, red spots that start at the head and spread to the rest of the body</li>
										<li>Diarrhea</li>

										</div>
								</div>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="measles-header2">Is it serious?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Measles can be dangerous, especially for babies and young children. From 2001-2013, 28% of children younger than 5 years old who had measles had to be treated in the hospital. For some children, measles can lead to:</span>
									<ul>
									 	<li>Pneumonia (a serious lung infection)</li>
										<li>Lifelong brain damage</li>
										<li>Deafness</li>
										<li>Death</li>
									</ul>
								</div><!-- end Measles first col first row -->
								<div class="col-md-6"><!-- Measles second col first row --> 
									<span class="measles-header2">How does measles spread?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Measles spreads when a person infected with the measles virus breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It is very contagious. You can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to 2 hours after that person is gone. And you can catch measles from an infected person even before they have a measles rash. Almost everyone who has not had the MMR shot will get measles if they are exposed to the measles virus.</span>

									</div>
								<br>
									<span class="measles-header2">Why should my child get the MMR shot?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>The MMR shot:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Protects your child from measles, a potentially serious disease (and also protects against mumps and rubella)</li>
										<li>Prevents your child from getting an uncomfortable rash and high fever from measles</li>
										<li>Keeps your child from missing school or childcare (and keeps you from missing work to care for your sick child)</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="measles-header2">Is the MMR shot safe?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Yes. The MMR shot is very safe, and it is effective at preventing	measles (as well as mumps and rubella). Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. But most children who get the MMR shot have no side effects.</span>

								<div class="col-md-6"><!-- Measles first col second row -->  
										<span class="measles-header2">What are the side effects?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Most children do not have any side effects from the shot. The side effects that do occur are usually very mild, such as a fever or rash. More serious side effects are rare. These may include high fever that could cause a seizure (in about 1 person out of every 3,000 who get the shot) and temporary pain and stiffness in joints (mostly in teens and adults).</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="measles-header2">Is there a link between the MMR shot and
									autism?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>No. Scientists in the United States and other countries have carefully studied the MMR shot. None has found a link between autism and the MMR shot.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="measles-header2">Where do measles cases in the United States come from?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Measles disease can come into this country when unvaccinated U.S. residents travel internationally or foreign visitors to the United States are exposed to measles in another country and travel into the United States. The risk of getting measles may be very high for unvaccinated U.S. residents who travel abroad.</span>
								</div><!-- end Measles first col second row -->
								<div class="col-md-6"><!-- Measles second col second row -->  
								<span> The reason for this high risk is because measles is common in other parts of the world, including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. Worldwide, about 20 million people get measles each year. When people with measles travel into the United States, they can spread the disease to unvaccinated people including children too young to be vaccinated.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="measles-header2">How many measles cases are there in the United States each year?</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>From 2001 to 2013, the number of measles cases reported in the United States ranged from 37 to 220. However, in some years like 2014, there were more measles cases than usual. In 2014, 668 people from 27 states were reported as having measles. Most of these people got measles in the United States after being exposed to someone who got measles while in another country. So far in 2015, more than 170 people in the U.S. have been reported to have measles. Most of these cases were part of a large outbreak linked to an amusement park in California.

									<span class="fluCaption flu-header2">FLU INFORMATION</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">What is the flu?</span>
								<br>								
									<span>Influenza (the flu) is an infection of the nose, throat, and lungs caused by influenza viruses. There are many different influenza viruses that are constantly changing. They cause illness, hospital stays and deaths in the United States each year. The flu can be very dangerous for children. Each year about 20,000 children younger than 5 years old are hospitalized from flu complications, like pneumonia.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">How serious is the flu?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Flu illness can vary from mild to severe. While the flu can be serious even in people who are otherwise healthy, it can be especially dangerous for young children and children of any age who have certain long term health conditions, including asthma (even mild or controlled), neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions, chronic lung disease, heart disease, blood disorders, endocrine disorders (such as diabetes), kidney, liver, and metabolic disorders, and weakened immune systems due to disease or medication. Children with these conditions and children who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy can have more severe illness from the flu.</span>			
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">How does the flu spread?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by droplets made when people with the flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get the flu by touching something that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, eyes or nose.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">What are the symptoms of the flu?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Symptoms of the flu can include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills, fatigue and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. Some people with the flu will not have a fever.</span>
								<br>
								<br>								
									<span class="flu-header2">How long can a sick person spread the flu to others?</span>
								<br>
									<span>People with the flu may be able to infect others by shedding virus from 1 day before getting sick to 5 to 7 days after. However, children and people with weakened immune systems can shed virus for longer, and might be still contagious past 5 to 7 days of being sick, especially if they still have symptoms.</span>
								<br>								
								<br>								
									<span class="flu-header2">Can my child go to school, day care or camp if he or she is sick?</span>
								<br>
									<span>No. Your child should stay home to rest and to avoid giving the flu to other children or caregivers.</span>

									<span>Keep your child home from school, day care or camp for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone. (Fever should be gone without the use of a fever-reducing medicine.) A fever is defined as 100°F (37.8°C) or higher.</span>
								<br>
								<br>

									<span class="flu-header2">How can I protect my child against the flu?</span>
								<br>
									<span>To protect against the flu, the first and most important thing you can do is to get a flu vaccine for yourself and your child.</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Vaccination is recommended for everyone 6 months
										and older.</li>
										<li>It’s especially important that young children and children with long term health conditions get vaccinated. (See list of conditions under “How Serious is the Flu?”)</li>
										<li>Caregivers of children with health conditions or of children younger than 6 months old should get vaccinated. (Babies younger than 6 months are too young to be vaccinated themselves.)</li>		
										<li>Another way to protect babies is to vaccinate pregnant women because research shows that this gives some protection to the baby both while the woman is pregnant and for a few months after the baby is born.</li>
									</ul>
									<span>A new flu vaccine is made each year to protect against the three flu viruses that research indicates are most likely to cause illness during the next flu season. Flu vaccines are made using strict safety and production measures. Over the years, millions of flu vaccines have been given in the United States with a very good safety record.</span>

									<span class="flu-header2">What should I use	for hand washing?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Washing hands with soap and water (for as long as it takes to sing the “Happy Birthday” song twice) will help protect against many germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">What are some of the other ways I can protect my child against the flu?</span>
								<br>
									<span>In addition to getting vaccinated, take – and encourage your child to take everyday steps that can help prevent the spread of germs.</span>
								<br>
									<span>This includes:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.</li>
										<li>Stay away from people who are sick.</li>											
										<li>Wash hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.</li>											
										<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way.</li>											
										<li>If someone in the household is sick, try to keep the sick person in a separate room from others in the household, if possible.</li>											
										<li>Keep surfaces like bedside tables, surfaces in the bathroom, kitchen counters and toys for children clean by wiping them down with a household disinfectant according to directions on the product label.</li>											
										<li>Throw tissues and other disposable items used by sick persons in your household in the trash.</li>
									</ul>
									<span>These everyday steps are a good way to reduce your chances of getting all sorts of illnesses, but a yearly flu vaccine is always the best way to specifically prevent the flu.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">What can I do if my child gets sick?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Talk to your doctor early if you are worried about your child’s illness.</span>
									<span>If your child is 5 years and older and does not have other health problems and gets flu-like symptoms, including a fever and/or cough, consult your doctor as needed and make sure your child gets plenty of rest and drinks enough fluids.</span>
									<span>If your child is younger than 5 years (and especially younger than 2 years) or of any age with a long term health condition (like asthma, a neurological</span>
								<br>
								<br>
								</div><!-- end first col of second row -->								
								<div class="col-md-6"><!-- second col of second row -->									
									<span> condition, or diabetes, for example) and develops flu-like symptoms, they are at risk for serious complications from the flu. Ask a doctor if your child should be examined.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">What if my child seems very sick?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Even children who have always been healthy before or had the flu before can get very sick from the flu.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span>Call for emergency care or take your child to a doctor right away if your child of any age has any of the warning or emergency signs below:</span>
									<ul>	
										<li>Fast breathing or trouble breathing</li>											
										<li>Bluish or gray skin color</li>											
										<li>Not drinking enough fluids
										(not going to the bathroom or making
										as much urine as they normally do)</li>	
										<li>Severe or persistent vomiting</li>
										<li>Not waking up or not interacting</li>
										<li>Being so irritable that the child
										does not want to be held</li>	
										<li>Flu-like symptoms improve but then
										return with fever and worse cough</li>	
										<li>Has other conditions (like heart or lung disease,
										diabetes,or asthma) and develops flu symptoms,
										including a fever and/or cough.</li>
									</ul>
								<br>
									<span class="flu-header2">Is there a medicine to treat the flu?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Antiviral drugs can treat flu illness. They can make people feel better and get better sooner and may prevent serious flu complications, like pneumonia, for example, that can lead to hospitalization and even death. These drugs are different from antibiotics, but they also need to be prescribed by a doctor. They work best when started during the first 2 days of illness. It’s very important that antiviral drugs be used early to treat the flu in people who are very sick (for example people who are in the hospital) or people who are at greater risk of having serious flu complications. Other people with flu illness may also benefit from taking antiviral drugs. These drugs can be given to children andpregnant women.</span>

									<span class="polio-header2">POLIO INFORMATION</span>
									<br>
									<br>
									<span>The best way to protect against polio is to get the polio vaccine. Doctors recommend that all children get the vaccine, also called IPV (or inactivated poliovirus).</span>
									<br>
									<br>
									<span class="polio-header2">Why should my child get the polio shot?</span>
								<br>
									<span>The polio shot:</span>
									<ul>
										<li>Protects your child from polio, a potentially serious disease</li>
										<li>Prevents your child from developing lifelong paralysis from polio</li>
									</ul>
									<span class="polio-header2">Is the polio shot safe?</span>
								</br>
									<span>Yes. The polio vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing polio. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Most children who get the polio shot have no side effects.</span>
								<br>

									<div class="col-md-10 polio-pic">
										<img src="images/PolioModal.png" class="img-responsive modal-pics">
									</div>
									</div>
								<br>
									<span class="polio-header2">What are the side effects?</span> 
								<br>
									<span>When side effects do occur, they are usually mild, like temporary redness and pain at the injection site.</span>
								<br>
								</div><!-- end Polio first col first row -->

									<span class="polio-header2">What is polio?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Polio (or poliomyelitis) is a disease caused by poliovirus. It
									can cause lifelong paralysis (can’t move parts of the body),
									and it can be deadly.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="polio-header2">What are the symptoms of poliovirus infection?</span>
								<br>									
									<span>Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. Some people (24 people out of 100) will have flu-like	symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days then go away on their own. In rare cases, poliovirus infection can be very serious. About 1 out of 100 people will have weakness or paralysis in their arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="polio-header2">Is it serious?</span>
								<br>
									<span>The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults, 30 or 40 years later. About 2 to 5 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="polio-header2">How does polio spread?</span>
								<br>
									<span>Poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with the stool of an infected person and droplets from a sneeze or
									cough. If you get stool or droplets from an infected person on your hands and you touch your mouth, you can get infected. Also, if you put objects, like toys that have stool or droplets on them, into your mouth, you can get infected.</span>
								<br>
									<span>An infected person may spread the virus to others
									immediately before, and usually 1 to 2 weeks after,
									developing symptoms. The virus may live in an infected
									person’s stool for many weeks. It can contaminate food and
									water when people do not wash their hands.</span>
								<br>
								<br>
									<span class="polio-header2">Do people still get polio in the United
									States?</span>
									<br>
									<span>No, the United States has been polio free for more than 30 years, but the disease is still occurring in other parts of the world. It would only take one traveler with polio from another country to bring polio back to the United States.</span>
